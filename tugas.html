    <h2 style="color:rgb(2, 2, 100)" >A Brief History of HTML</h2>
    <h3 style="color:rgb(7, 7, 77)">1993 - Present</h3>
    <p> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.Since then ,there have been many diffeent
        versions of HTML .The most widely used version throughout the 200's was
        <b>HTML 4.01.</b> 
        which became an official standard in December 1999.
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p> Another version ,
        <b>XHTML,</b>
        was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markub language that is used to create other markub
        languages.Hundreds of XML languages are in use today ,including GML (Geography Markub Language),
        <b>MathML, MusicML,</b>
        and 
        <b>RSS</b>
        (Really Simple Syndication).Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML),their content
        can easly be shared across applications .This makes XML potentially very powerful,and it's no suprise that the 
        W3C would create an XML version of HTML(again ,called XHTML).XHTML became an official standard in 2000,and was
        updated in 2002.XHTML is very similar to HTML,but has stricter rules.Strict rules are necessary for all XML 
        languages,because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible.You'll learn more about
        the differences between HTML and XHTML in 
        <u style="color:rgb(7, 7, 86)">unit2.</u>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>Most pages on the Web today were bulit using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.However,in recent years ,the W3C 
        (in collaboration with another organization,the
        <u style="color:rgb(7, 7, 86)">WHATWG),</u>
        has been working on a brand new version of HTML,
        <b>HTML5 </b>
        .Currently (2011),HTML5 is still a draft specification ,and is not yet an official atandart .However ,it is 
        already widely supported by browsers and other webenabled devices ,and is the way of the future.Therefore, 
        <b>HTML5 is the primery language taught in this course</b>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <P>The following table shows s list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages usig
        different versions of HTML .In the early days of the Web.HTML (version 1.2)was very simple ,but over time new
        version were released that added more and more features.Still,if web designers wanted to add content or features 
        that HTML didn't support,they would have to do so whit non-standard proprietary technologies such as Adoble Flash 
        .These technologies would require users to install browser pulg-ins,and in some cases meant that certain users
        would be unable to access the content (for example ,iPhones and iPads don't support Flash).
